1. How do I approach designing software?

	- <b>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?</b><br>
The project has helped me to craft more organized code as well as applying textures to an object in opengl. Funny enough, I had tried to use opengl in the past and the course overall also provided me with the ability to apply opengl syntax to projects. <br/>

	- <b>What design process did you follow for your project work?</b><br>
	In order to make the project work, I had to be very organized with my functions and namespace. I had to first research the project's requirements, follow the course resources, then apply it all to my project.
	
	- <b>How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?</b><br>
	The amount of research that goes into a project before I begin it could prove a very useful tactic to apply to future work. Even looking at code that has already finished works to understand my future projects even more could prove beneficial.
	
2. How do I approach developing programs?

	- <b>What new development strategies did you use while working in your 3D scene?</b><br>
	Keeping function declarations and function definitions separated was extremely helpful. Looking back at it, I could have utilized different header files in order to keep things even more organized.
	
	- <b>How did iteration factor into your development?</b><br>
	Every milestone after the first, I would look back into the previous and see what could be improved and worked on. If I found that the code could be better organized or done in a more efficient way, I would create another iteration of the project, this also helped when encountering bugs, as I could see where the previous iteration worked and attempt to find where the new iteration stopped working.
	
	- <b>How was your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project's completion?</b><br>
	Before trying to code something now, I attempt to draw it and pseudocode it out after doing research on the problem at hand. For example, if I wanted to learn how to render multiple objects to the screen, I would research it first, pseudocode it, then visualize the code's execution before actually coding it.
	
3. How can computer scienve help me in reaching my goals?

	- <b>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?</b><br>
	When learning, it's essential to utilize all resources provided to you as well as resources that can be found online. The skills learned from this project can be utilized to improve the quality of learning new solutions to problems in future education.
	
	- <b>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?</b><br>
	When developing games, opengl can be utilized to create a game engine which gives a developer much more control over their projects. Using a game engine that is already created such as Unity or Unreal Engine may or may not have limitations or contracts that need to be followed to release a game commercially. However, creating one's own engine with opengl allows for absolute control over a project's commercial release.
